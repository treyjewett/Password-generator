# Password-generator

## The Project

Passwords are becoming increasingly complicated. Between capital letters, numbers, and special characters; it can be a challenge to create a password that meets all criteria some websites are requiring. This application is designed to take all of the guess-work out of creating a password and creates one for you. Just click, and answer a few questions to tailer a password to your needs!

## Code Utilized

This project was constructed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The bulk of the code is in Javascript because there is not much styling involved.

## What to Expect

When the Password Generator page is loaded:
- A box centered on the page is present with the title: "Password Generator" and a sub-title: "Generate a Password".
- The user is presented with a red button that reads: "Generate Password".
- Upon clicking the button, the user is shown a prompt to specify how long the password should be (between 8 and 128 characters).
- If the user enters a number outside of the constraints of the prompt, and error message is shown and they will be directed to try again.
- The next 4 prompts ask yes or no (y / n) questions regarding what kind of characters they would like to include in the password.
- The 4 categories are: capital letters, lower-case letters, numbers, and special characters.
- If the user does not select any ("n" for all prompts), an error is shown and they are directed to start again.
- If the prompts are followed correctly and the user specifies the character types as directed, a randomized password will be generated.
- The user can then highlight the given password, copy it, and use it wherer they like.
- The password generator will work again if the button is pressed, without having to re-load the page.

## Lessons Learned

This project was great fun, and has a practical use! Getting into the behind-the-scene code of a web-API was quite a change after CSS. I thoroughly enjoyed the problem solving aspect as well as seeing the product work in the end. JavaScript can be a lot of fun.
